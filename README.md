# Some Command Line Interaction

 will think about it, cause I really don't know how bad I am at coding. It really bad.

```bash
Command Line Interaction
  |
  |-- Command Line Games
  |     |
  |     |-- rockpaperscissor (python)
  |     |-- RussianRoutlette (java)
  |     |-- tictactoe (javascript)
  |     |-- Fish Tank (C++)
  |     |-- LotteryGame (C++)
  |     |-- cheapBattleRoyal (C++)
  |     |-- Tree Visualizer (C++)
  |
  |-- Good Practices
        |
        |-- parse CSV (2D array practices)
        |-- bitWise (C++)
        |-- others
```

## Command Line Games

Its self-explanatory. I have made some games in command line. I have used python, c++, java and javascript for this.

Down below are implementations.

## Good Practices

Some small pieces of code that I think are interesting.

### parse CSV

Just read it

### bitWise

AND, OR, XOR, did not include NOT, LSHIFT, RSHIFT

### Sorting n Search Algorithms

In C++, 7 algorithms implemented as well as different ways to implement them.

There is a 12th algorithm version but that is a bit stingy.
